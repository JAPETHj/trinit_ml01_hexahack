here we have use YOLO for damge detection specifically version 5 
YOLO is a real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in an image or video. It uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object. 
Working:
>Input Image: YOLO takes an input image and divides it into a grid system. Each cell in the grid is responsible for detecting objects within itself.
>Feature Extraction: YOLO uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input image.This network consists of several convolutional and pooling layers that help in identifying the objects.
>Object Detection: After extracting features, YOLO predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object. It does this by using a series of fully connected layers that output a fixed number of bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell.
>Non-Max Suppression: YOLO uses a technique called non-max suppression to eliminate duplicate detections. This technique selects the bounding box with the highest confidence score and eliminates the rest of the boxes that overlap with it.
>Post-Processing: Finally, YOLO applies some post-processing techniques to refine the bounding boxes and class probabilities.

BRIEF CODE EXPLANATION :
Environment Setup:

Import essential libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations, pandas for data processing, and os for interacting with the operating system.
Clone YOLOv5 Repository:

Clone the YOLOv5 repository from GitHub and change the working directory to the cloned repository.
Install Required Libraries:

Install the gdown library, which will be used later for downloading files from Google Drive.
Download Dataset:

Download a dataset in ZIP format from a specified URL.
Download another file from Google Drive.
Prepare Dataset:

Import the shutil library for file operations.
Define paths for the input and working directories.
Copy the dataset (train, test, and valid folders) to the working directory.
The script removes any existing folder with the same name before copying to avoid conflicts.
Create YAML File:

Write a YAML configuration file (roaddamage2022.yaml) that specifies the paths for training, validation, and test sets, as well as the number of classes and class names.
Uninstall Weights and Biases (WandB):

Uninstall the WandB library, which is not used in this script.
Train the Model:

Train the YOLOv5 model using the train.py script with specified parameters:
Image size: 720x720 pixels
Batch size: 8
Number of epochs: 50
Configuration file for the model architecture: yolov5s.yaml
Dataset configuration file: roaddamage2022.yaml
List Training Results:

List the files in the training output directory.
Change Directory:

Change the working directory to the YOLOv5 directory.
Generate Downloadable Link for Results:

Create a link to download the results in a zip file.
Test the Model:

Use the trained model to perform object detection on the test set.
Show Sample Results:

Display sample results, including precision-recall curve, F1 score curve, precision curve, confusion matrix, and images with detected road damage.
Create Results Zip File:

Package the generated result images and charts into a zip file for easy sharing or downloading.
